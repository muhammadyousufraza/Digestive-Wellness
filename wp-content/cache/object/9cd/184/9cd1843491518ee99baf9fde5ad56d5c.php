(1-6) However, some researchers are questioning the potential negative impact of longer term strict FODMAP restriction.

&nbsp;
<h4>What is the low FODMAP Diet?</h4>
&nbsp;

FODMAP stands for "Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols. These fermentable short-chain carbohydrates are found in many foods we eat and are poorly absorbed in the small intestine.

Numerous studies have shown a low FODMAP diet to reduce the symptoms of IBS in up to 80% of people and to improve their quality of life.

&nbsp;
<h4>How does the low FODMAP Diet reduce IBS symptoms?</h4>
&nbsp;

When bacteria in our gut break down carbohydrates they ferment them producing gas. When FODMAP containing foods arrive in the lower small intestine and colon, these poorly absorbed carbohydrates provide the food for bacterial fermentation, which then leads to gas, bloating, pain and general abdominal discomfort.

If someone has SIBO or Large Intestinal Dysbiosis then high FODMAP foods feed the bacterial over growths producing excess gas.

&nbsp;
<h4>Potential problems with the low FODMAP Diet</h4>
&nbsp;

There is no disputing that in the majority of IBS sufferers a low FODMAP diet will help them manage their symptoms but it wont  treat or correct the underlying cause of the symptoms and if followed for a length of time may have negative effects.

The low FODMAP diet works because it stops feeding bacterial overgrowth in the gut reducing fermentation and gas production. But by starving the over growths we also stop feeding the good bacteria in our gut which fulfill many beneficial roles for our health..

Two studies have shown that a diet very low in FODMAPs carried out over only 3 and 4 weeks, respectively, is associated with a reduction in the abundance of Bifidobacteria. (7, 8)

This is interesting as other studies have shown reduced Bifidobacteria in IBS patients compared with healthy people (9, 10) and that a low abundance of Bifidobacteria is associated with a high pain score in IBS patients. (11, 12, 13)  Because Bifidobacteria plays a big part in a healthy gut and low numbers are associated with IBS then the effect of a strict low-FODMAP diet might be counterproductive.

Strict reduction of FODMAP intake was also associated with a reduction in butyrate producing bacteria and increase in mucin degrading bacteria. Other studies show a correlation between IBS symptoms and low butyrate and increased mucin degrading bacteria again showing the potential counterproductive nature of a strict low FODMAP diet. (8)

There is some evidence that people with gastrointestinal disorders who undergo dietary change may be at increased risk for disordered eating behaviors. Some people can be anxious and concerned with the preparation of their food and experience anxiety around unfamiliar foods, leading them to avoid social situations around eating.

&nbsp;
<h4>Treat the Underlying Cause</h4>
&nbsp;

The low FODMAP diet works so well because you stop feeding bacterial over growth in the gut. For people who have tried a low-FODMAP diet and noticed significant improvements in their symptoms, it’s easy to think that this must be the answer, unfortunately, this is not the case. A low-FODMAP (or low-carbohydrate) diet will keep symptoms under control but a strict long term FODMAP diet will not correct the cause of the symptoms and may also have a negative effect as outlined above.

It is important you discover and treat the root cause of your symptoms so you don't get stuck on a restrictive diet long term.

Proper functional gut testing such as a SIBO Breath Test and Comprehensive Stool Analysis will help us identify any bacterial over growths and imbalances in your gut and find the source of fermentation.

&nbsp;

Once we have an understanding as to what's happening inside your gut a natural treatment protocol can be prescribed to treat the underlying cause and restore proper digestive function. A low FODMAP diet can be part of this process but the end goal is that there is no need to be on a restrictive diet once the gut is in balance.

<h4>Key Points:</h4>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">The low FODMAP diet can be helpful for symptom management but is not a direct treatment for IBS or SIBO.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Long term strict FODMAP restriction can have adverse effects such as a reduction in Bifido and butyrate producing bacteria, and creating anxiety and fear around food.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Strict low FODMAP is a short term elimination diet which should be followed for only 4-6 weeks, followed by a reintroduction phase, then a diet personalisation phase.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Discover and treat the root cause of your symptoms, with functional gut testing and natural treatment protocols, so you are not stuck on a restrictive diet.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The low FODMAP diet was never  designed to be a long term or lifestyle diet, it should be used to manage your symptoms whilst you treat the underlying cause.
