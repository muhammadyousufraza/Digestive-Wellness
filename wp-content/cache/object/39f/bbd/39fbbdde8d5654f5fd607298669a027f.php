<b>Bloating, diarrhea, constipation, gas, and abdominal pain</b> are the most common complaints I see, and I understand how frustrating and debilitating these symptoms can be. Despite what you may have been told there is a reason you are experiencing the symptoms you are. Latest research has shown there are causes for IBS, which can be treated. So, you donâ€™t have to â€˜just liveâ€™ with your symptoms, and itâ€™s definitely not â€˜all in your headâ€™.
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #167d7f;"><b>But my test results are normal</b></span></h1>
Like most of my patients, youâ€™ve probably had all the tests: colonoscopy, gastroscopy, ultrasound, etc and been told that everything is normal. Problem is, when your doctor runs these tests they arenâ€™t necessarily looking for the cause of your symptoms, rather they are ruling out more serious conditions, such as bowel cancer, Crohns disease, ovarian cancer, etc. Whilst this is a very important step, it doesnâ€™t help you come to a better understanding of your symptoms and can often times leave you even more confused and helpless.
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #167d7f;"><b>Discovering the true cause of your symptoms</b></span></h1>
It is important to understand that IBS is just <b>a label for a cluster of symptoms</b>, and no two IBS sufferers are experiencing exactly the same symptoms. Therefore, no one treatment or generic advice is going to work for everyone. Your symptom pattern is unique to you and may have one of many causes. The answer lies in discovering the true cause of <b>your</b> symptoms, then employing a treatment plan based on those findings. At the Digestive Wellness Clinic, an experienced Naturopath who specialises in digestive health, will take the time to listen to you and your history, conducting a thorough case history, symptom analysis and, if indicated, referral for functional pathology testing, to discover whatâ€™s really behind your symptoms.
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #167d7f;"><b>What causes IBS?</b></span></h1>
Some of the more common reasons I find for the symptoms of IBS include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.digestivewellness.com.au/dysbiosis-sydney-naturopath/">Intestinal Dysbiosis</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.digestivewellness.com.au/sibo-sydney-naturopath/">Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)</a></li>

 	<li><a href="https://www.digestivewellness.com.au/digestive-secretions-sydney-naturopath/">Altered gastric secretions (gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, bile)</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.digestivewellness.com.au/ibs-diet-sydney-naturopath/">Food malabsorption</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #167d7f;"><b>How do I find out whatâ€™s causing my symptoms?</b></span></h1>
