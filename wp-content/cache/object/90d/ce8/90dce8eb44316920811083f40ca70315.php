I was at a complete loss, with terrible digestive problems, pain and brain fog symptoms which were affecting my life, work, and happiness. I didn’t have a lot of faith that I could be fixed, a feeling I’m sure anyone who suffers with chronic digestive issues can understand – it just felt like there was so much going on that it would be impossible to identify and fix a concrete problem<br />
However, Matt’s logical, friendly, understanding and very detailed approach of testing and healing meant that he identified everything that was wrong and how we needed to fix it. I am over the moon! I am now symptom free and have my life back. I highlyrecommend going to see Matt.</div>

Now after seeing Matt and following the treatments all of the symptoms are gone! We rebalanced my gut flora, got rid of the nasties and boosted the good guys, and I was just more informed on what to look out for with regards to food. It took time and discipline but so worth it! I got my life back plain and simple.<br />
I was so distressed when I first met Matt and was at my wits end doing my own research, attempts to self cure. I remember asking him: ‘so will we just get to a point where I can manage my symptoms?’ Matt gave me a quizzical look and said, ‘No, we’ll sort this’. And we did!</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">For years I was struggling with my digestive health. I had pain when eating bloating, cramps  and I wasn’t absorbing what I was eating. I tried many different alternative health therapies  but none of them gave me lasting results. I was at a point where I felt I couldn’t heal. I  thought it would take years, and that I would never be able to eat wheat or dairy again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After treatment with Matt my digestion is completely different! I can eat moderate amounts  of wheat and dairy without pain. All the meals I eat digest easily – I don’t get cramps,  bloating or pain anymore during or after eating. My biggest improvement was not having  flatulence during the day!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
These changes make me feel more confident in myself. I feel that I can wear the clothes I  want to wear without worrying about bloating. My energy levels have improved so I feel  better throughout the day. I feel more alive, happy and generally get more out of my day.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Matt is so lovely to work with. He is very kind and takes the time to analyze all of your  symptoms. The food plan is easy to follow and Matt takes into account your dietary  preferences. I had a great experience working with Matt and his support through the whole  process will not be forgotten.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">I came to Matt because I have Hashimoto&#8217;s disease, and I wanted to get my antibodies  down (they were well over 1000, and had been for years). Though Hashis is a thyroid  disease, I believe the root cause, in my case, has stemmed from my gut. In addition to  digestive issues, my biggest symptom was brain fog and fatigue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After a bunch of tests, we  discovered that I have SIBO, and Matt set up a treatment plan. Within 5 months of  addressing the SIBO, my antibodies dropped to 190 (from over 1000!). If they continue to  drop then I’ll be heading into remission, much to my GPs disbelief. My brain fog has lifted,  and as corny as it sounds, ​I feel like a different person energy wise.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Matt was the first  health professional who helped me search for the root cause of my symptoms,  rather than just putting a “bandaid” on them, and I am so grateful for his  guidance. I would highly recommend Matt, if you have any underlying gut issues.  He might make you give up wine temporarily, but he’s a nice guy!</div>

The stomach  discomfort would come and go less, and became less intense. After months of treatment,  the discomfort was no more. I was over the moon and in debt to Matt for his counsel.

Although I am an extremely active  person i did not feel healthy, the bloating made me feel like I was carrying extra weight and  I often felt lethargic. After seeing Matt and commencing the treatment recommended by  him I immediately saw results, over the course of 3-4 months the bloating and constipation  completely disappeared, i was able to reintroduce all food groups back into my diet that  generally I could not eat prior to treatment.<br />
I have completed my treatment with Matt and my digestive health has never been better  with no signs of any symptoms and I am free to eat anything I want to without worrying! <br />
I would recommend Matt to anyone experiencing similar symptoms, he thoroughly explains  each phase of the treatment, carefully tracks your progress over the course of the  treatment, makes any adjustments necessary and is always on hand to answer any  questions and is well worth the time and money especially if like me it affects your day to  day life. </div>

Overall, I felt physically exhausted and extremely unwell when  I first came to see Matt. My immune system was also weak which meant that I was  vulnerable to catching any kind of bug going around. After committing to the treatment plan  Matt set out for me, which continued over a period of around 6-7 months, I can honestly say  that I am now cured and no longer suffer from any of the symptoms mentioned above.  I  haven’t felt this healthy for years – I feel amazing! I would highly recommend Matt to  anyone who is experiencing poor gut health. He is incredibly knowledgeable and uses an  evidence based approach to healing. He is able to discover the root cause of symptoms so  that treatment can be tailored to combating the problem at its source. I can now move  forward with a quality of life that I was unable to achieve – due to chronic illness – for so  long and this is something that I am immensely grateful for.<br />

<p>My General Practitioner and Gastroenterologist led me to the low-FODMAP diet, that is amazing for symptoms but not a long term solution.</p>
<p>Functional medicine addressed my issues with digestion and my multiple deficiencies, but I was still very symptomatic if I strayed from my very restricted diet.</p>
<p>My own research led me to SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), as a possible cause of my IBS, but I struggled to find a practitioner that is current with all its emerging research and testing.</p>
<p>After finding Matt&#8217;s clinic and the 15 min free phone consultation, that he offers, I was hopeful (and correct) that he was the practitioner that could move me forward from my impasse.</p>
<p>Matt is very professional and up-to-date with all of the latest research and treatment plans. My journey to health was not short but Matt was always available for questions, happy to adjust treatment, and always encouraging.</p>
<p>These gut issues can be complex to treat but I am so thankful that I found Matt to guide me through to my current health.<br />

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">I got an infection in my stomach from something I’ve been exposed to or ate, then my life  changed dramatically afterwards! <br />
I used to eat everything &#038; had no problems with food or digestion until this infection, I then  suddenly stopped digesting food, it would sit there for days, ferment and cause severe  chronic constipation &#038; bloating associated with extreme pain. I couldn’t eat properly which  had a significant effect on my personal life, work, concentration &#038; pretty much everything. <br />
I have been to many doctors &#038; done many tests with only disappointment &#038; no  improvement. I was desperate &#038; depressed, my life turned upside down until i searched the  internet &#038; found information about Matt and the Digestive Wellness Clinic and only then  when I started to see light at the end of the tunnel after I was told that I’d just have to live  like this, something I refused to believe. <br />
Matt diagnosed me with SIBO and that explained the fatigue, nutrient malabsorption and all  the symptoms I was experiencing. Matt put me on a treatment program of natural <br />
supplements and diet that I followed with his support and guidance throughout the journey.  I started noticing improvements after about 2 months and after 6 months I could say that I  was completely back to normal. Matt was always very supportive &#038; responsive to my  queries, always calm, always positive and reassuring. He gave me strength to keep going  and complete the journey until full recovery, until i got my life back! I’m back to cycling, I’ve  got much more energy now to spend good time with the family, to work properly and do  whatever I want! <br />
I would recommend Matt to those who suffer from any gut issue &#038; all those who reached  dead ends and tried everything without success. Matt is knowledgeable and experienced,  he customises the treatment according to one’s conditions and needs. He is very  understanding, caring and a true professional! </div>

I did suffer from sudden weight loss, anxiety, depression, disturbed sleep, IBS and  many more embarrassing symptoms, my life was in a painful mess, physically and mentally.  Matthew recommended I take a comprehensive stool test which I did and the test had  proven I had a very bad Candida and Klebsiella overgrowth after a very strong antibiotics  treatment a year before for a parasite Blastocystis Hominis and unhealthy diet habits. The  Blasto was gone but I had let the bad yeast and bacteria in by killing most of my good  bacteria.  I thought I would have to live with these symptoms for the rest of my life. The  Digestive Wellness Clinic has turned my life around and I have not had this much energy in  years along with healthy weight gain that has also improved my gym workouts. The biggest  wow factor for me is that I no longer have anxiety or depression which I have had most of  my adult life!  If I could recommend one thing is that you will need patience and a lot of will  power and you will get your life back. I have also been very well educated by Matt on how  to live a healthy life with good diet habits and probiotics. I have my life back!!</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">During a holiday in Vietnam 2 years ago I picked up two parasites (D. Fragilis and  Blastocystis hominis) which were causing:  </p>
<p>frequent diarrhoea and abdominal pain<br />
general fatigue <br />
bouts of a strange tingling/vibration through my body</p>
<p>I had been on a gluten free diet for 4 years at this stage and had been having  episodes that were like hypoglycaemia with feelings of extreme hunger followed  by sweating/dizziness that were resolved with juice or a gluten free snack bar.  Over a period of 18 months my GP and Gastroenterologist had treated me with 5  different courses of antibiotics, most of them combination courses, one with 4  drugs at once which made me feel more unwell than the parasites.  These  managed to get rid of the Blastocystis but not the D. Fragilis and my symptoms  were unchanged.  I was feeling really fed up with the ongoing diarrhoea, fatigue and general  unwellness.  After 6 months of treatment with Matt I am now parasite and symptom free.  I  have more energy and my partner has commented that the “old me” is now back  again.  I am no longer getting the strange vibrations or the hypoglycaemic episodes.  I’m  also introducing small amounts of gluten back into my diet eating sourdough  bread with no ill effects.  It was a difficult 6 months of treatment as the diet was very restrictive (especially  over Christmas), but it was absolutely worth it!  Not only have the parasites gone,  but my overall gut health is vastly improved.  Matt is a great practitioner and I would highly recommend him.  His knowledge of  gut health is extensive and his treatments work.  He is very professional and is a  great educator, providing detailed explanations so that you understand what’s  happening He’s also really supportive throughout the treatment, responding very  quickly to any queries and questions. </div>

I knew I wanted to feel healthier overall and eliminate the pain and imbalances completely. After Dr.’s tests couldn’t locate an actionable issue for my digestive symptoms, Matt’s recommended tests did. Working with Matt to resolve these issues collaboratively was enlightening and supportive. It was honestly one of the best investments for my health. Recovery after working with Matt has seen me being able to live healthier, enjoy food again with friends and family and envision greater health goals for myself. I have recommended Matt to family and friends and cannot thank him enough for the invaluable expertise and support he provided.<br />

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">In 2019 I fell extremely ill and lost over 9kgs in 2 days. I was admitted to hospital and remained there for 14days. After many tests nothing was diagnosed. A couple of months later I decided to move to Sydney where I had some more tests. Immediately they found trace of a parasite.<br />
My health had deteriorated rapidly, I had no energy, moody,tired,headaches,poor circulation the list was endless. I found it very hard to deal with because before that I was training six days a week and running 10k and 21k races etc.<br />
Matt @ Digestive Wellness came on recommendation to me. After my consultation we introduced a plan of supplements and dietary to work with over the coming months.<br />
Just 2 weeks in I noticed a big change in how I was starting to feel for the better. My energy levels have started to lift again almost immediately, so I was absolutely stoked with that and that gave me the will to push harder towards our final goal of getting me back to where I was before I fell ill. So a little over a year later I have never felt better, sleeping, eating, training again and just feeling so good in myself.<br />
I would highly recommend Matt to anyone! I felt from my consultation the weight of the past number of months had just been lifted because Matt was so knowledgeable about his findings and the plan that was immediately implemented. A massive thank you Matt I cannot thank you enough.<br />

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">After getting sick on a trip to India over 5 years ago, and more recently taking a course of Roaccutane I’ve struggled with severe upper abdominal bloating and cramping almost immediately after eating. It got to the point where I was avoiding eating at restaurants and even wearing jeans. I was left feeling lost and after multiple unsuccessful courses of antibiotics and an IBS diagnosis,<br />
I thought that things wouldn’t change for me. It is hard to put into words how happy I am with the improvements I&#8217;ve seen thanks to Matt. I genuinely feel like I have my life back. I feel so much more confident and have since been able to reintroduce foods I haven&#8217;t been able to eat for years. Matt is extremely empathetic, knowledgeable and from our first interaction was able to clearly articulate the areas of focus for treatment and the multiple options available to me.<br />
Matt has a wealth of knowledge about gastrointestinal issues and is able to communicate it in an easy to understand way. Throughout my treatment, Matt has been my biggest advocate and has kept me on track and my results are a testament to his commitment and guidance. Thank you Matt!<br />

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Matt has been a godsend for me and I am constantly recommending him to others with digestive health problems. I had struggled with IBS-D symptoms for so long that I can’t even remember when it started. I’d seen many different doctors and had been on a low FODMAP diet for over 5 years, which had helped to ease the symptoms, but over time these had continued to worsen and other problems had emerged.<br />
In desperation, I found Matt and via phone consultations between my home in Queensland and his office in Sydney he turned it all around. Having far more knowledge than anyone else I had seen, he was able to quickly identify I had SIBO (confirmed by a test). His approach was evidence-based, the treatment was specific to the problems I was experiencing, and his support materials were excellent.<br />
 I can now eat normally without being constantly bloated, having abdominal pain, or needing to run to the bathroom! Also, as an added bonus, the treatment fixed menstrual problems I had always experienced (e.g. painful &amp; irregular periods, menstrual migraines). Matt’s advice has made such a difference and I’m so incredibly grateful for his help.<br />

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">To learn more about the testing and treatment options available it is recommended you take a free 15 minute phone consultation. During this call you can learn more about the programme and have all your questions answered. This call is to determine if we are a good fit for one another rather than a history or complete consultation. There is no obligation, and no strings attached.<br />
It is quick and easy to book your free 15-minute phone consultation using the online calendar. Just click the button below, choose a date and time convenient for you, enter your details, and Matt will call you at your chosen time.</div>
