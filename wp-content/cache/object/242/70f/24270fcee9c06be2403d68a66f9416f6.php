<p>Choosing to see Matt was the best decision Iâ€™ve made, regarding my health. I was at a complete loss, with terrible digestive problems, pain and brain fog symptoms which were affecting my life, work, and happiness. I didnâ€™t have a lot of faith that I could be fixed, a feeling Iâ€™m sure anyone who suffers with chronic digestive issues can understand â€“ it just felt like there was so much going on that it would be impossible to identify and fix a concrete problem</p>
<p>However, Mattâ€™s logical, friendly, understanding and very detailed approach of testing and healing meant that he identified everything that was wrong and how we needed to fix it. I am over the moon! I am now symptom free and have my life back. I highly<br />recommend going to see Matt.</p>[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built="1" module_class="testi-cli" _builder_version="4.0.6" custom_padding="0px||28px||false|false"][et_pb_row _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_column type="4_4" _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.0.6" header_2_font="Raleway|600|||||||" header_2_text_color="#167d7f" header_2_font_size="39px"]<h2>Sarah (NSW, Australia) </h2>[/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.7.7" text_font="Raleway|600|||||||" text_text_color="#000000" text_font_size="25px" text_line_height="45px" text_orientation="center" custom_padding="30px||||false|false"]<h3><strong>â€˜I am over the moon!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now after seeing Matt and following the treatments all of the symptoms are gone! We rebalanced my gut flora, got rid of the nasties and boosted the good guys, and I was just more informed on what to look out for with regards to food. It took time and discipline but so worth it! I got my life back plain and simple.</p>
<p>I was so distressed when I first met Matt and was at my wits end doing my own research, attempts to self cure. I remember asking him: â€˜so will we just get to a point where I can manage my symptoms?â€™ Matt gave me a quizzical look and said, â€˜No, weâ€™ll sort thisâ€™.

I had pain when eating bloating, crampsÂ  and I wasnâ€™t absorbing what I was eating. I tried many different alternative health therapiesÂ  but none of them gave me lasting results. I was at a point where I felt I couldnâ€™t heal. IÂ  thought it would take years, and that I would never be able to eat wheat or dairy again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After treatment with Matt my digestion is completely different! I can eat moderate amountsÂ  of wheat and dairy without pain. All the meals I eat digest easily â€“ I donâ€™t get cramps,Â  bloating or pain anymore during or after eating. My biggest improvement was not havingÂ  flatulence during the day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes make me feel more confident in myself. I feel that I can wear the clothes IÂ  want to wear without worrying about bloating. My energy levels have improved so I feelÂ  better throughout the day. I feel more alive, happy and generally get more out of my day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt is so lovely to work with. He is very kind and takes the time to analyze all of yourÂ  symptoms. The food plan is easy to follow and Matt takes into account your dietaryÂ  preferences. I had a great experience working with Matt and his support through the wholeÂ  process will not be forgotten.</p>

Though Hashis is a thyroidÂ  disease, I believe the root cause, in my case, has stemmed from my gut. In addition toÂ  digestive issues, my biggest symptom was brain fog and fatigue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a bunch of tests, weÂ  discovered that I have SIBO, and Matt set up a treatment plan. Within 5 months ofÂ  addressing the SIBO, my antibodies dropped to 190 (from over 1000!). If they continue toÂ  drop then Iâ€™ll be heading into remission, much to my GPs disbelief. My brain fog has lifted,Â  and as corny as it sounds, â€‹I feel like a different person energy wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt was the firstÂ  health professional who helped me search for the root cause of my symptoms,Â  rather than just putting a â€œbandaidâ€ on them, and I am so grateful for hisÂ  guidance. I would highly recommend Matt, if you have any underlying gut issues.Â  He might make you give up wine temporarily, but heâ€™s a nice guy!</p>

Overall, I felt physically exhausted and extremely unwell whenÂ  I first came to see Matt. My immune system was also weak which meant that I wasÂ  vulnerable to catching any kind of bug going around.

<p>Matt diagnosed me with SIBO and that explained the fatigue, nutrient malabsorption and allÂ  the symptoms I was experiencing. Matt put me on a treatment program of naturalÂ </p>
<p>supplements and diet that I followed with his support and guidance throughout the journey.Â  I started noticing improvements after about 2 months and after 6 months I could say that IÂ  was completely back to normal. Matt was always very supportive & responsive to myÂ  queries, always calm, always positive and reassuring. He gave me strength to keep goingÂ  and complete the journey until full recovery, until i got my life back! Iâ€™m back to cycling, Iâ€™veÂ  got much more energy now to spend good time with the family, to work properly and doÂ  whatever I want!Â 
I would recommend Matt to those who suffer from any gut issue & all those who reachedÂ  dead ends and tried everything without success. Matt is knowledgeable and experienced,Â  he customises the treatment according to oneâ€™s conditions and needs. He is veryÂ  understanding, caring and a true professional!Â </p>[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built="1" module_class="testi-cli" _builder_version="4.0.6" custom_padding="0px||||false|false"][et_pb_row _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_column type="4_4" _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.0.6" header_2_font="Montserrat|600|||||||" header_2_text_color="#167d7f" header_2_font_size="39px"]<h2>Dina (NSW, Australia)Â  </h2>[/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.7.7" text_font="Montserrat|600|||||||" text_text_color="#000000" text_font_size="24px" text_line_height="45px" text_orientation="center" custom_padding="30px||||false|false"]<h3>â€˜<strong>He gave me strength to keep going and complete the journey until full recovery,Â  until i got my life back!

I did suffer from sudden weight loss, anxiety, depression, disturbed sleep, IBS andÂ  many more embarrassing symptoms, my life was in a painful mess, physically and mentally.Â  Matthew recommended I take a comprehensive stool test which I did and the test hadÂ  proven I had a very bad Candida and Klebsiella overgrowth after a very strong antibioticsÂ  treatment a year before for a parasite Blastocystis Hominis and unhealthy diet habits. TheÂ  Blasto was gone but I had let the bad yeast and bacteria in by killing most of my goodÂ  bacteria.  I thought I would have to live with these symptoms for the rest of my life. TheÂ  Digestive Wellness Clinic has turned my life around and I have not had this much energy inÂ  years along with healthy weight gain that has also improved my gym workouts. The biggestÂ  wow factor for me is that I no longer have anxiety or depression which I have had most ofÂ  my adult life!  If I could recommend one thing is that you will need patience and a lot of willÂ  power and you will get your life back. I have also been very well educated by Matt on howÂ  to live a healthy life with good diet habits and probiotics. I have my life back!!</p>[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built="1" module_class="testi-cli" _builder_version="4.0.6" custom_padding="0px||||false|false"][et_pb_row _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_column type="4_4" _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.0.6" header_2_font="Montserrat|600|||||||" header_2_text_color="#167d7f" header_2_font_size="39px"]<h2>Nigel (NSW, Australia)</h2>[/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.7.7" text_font="Montserrat|600|||||||" text_text_color="#000000" text_font_size="24px" text_line_height="45px" text_orientation="center" custom_padding="30px||||false|false"]<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>â€˜The Digestive Wellness Clinic has turned my life around and I have not had thisÂ  much energy in years along with healthy weight gain that has also improved myÂ  gym workouts.

Fragilis andÂ  Blastocystis hominis) which were causing:Â  </p>
<ul>
<li>frequent diarrhoea and abdominal pain</li>
<li>general fatigueÂ </li>
<li>bouts of a strange tingling/vibration through my body</li>
</ul>
<p>I had been on a gluten free diet for 4 years at this stage and had been havingÂ  episodes that were like hypoglycaemia with feelings of extreme hunger followedÂ  by sweating/dizziness that were resolved with juice or a gluten free snack bar.Â  Over a period of 18 months my GP and Gastroenterologist had treated me with 5Â  different courses of antibiotics, most of them combination courses, one with 4Â  drugs at once which made me feel more unwell than the parasites.  TheseÂ  managed to get rid of the Blastocystis but not the D. Fragilis and my symptomsÂ  were unchanged.Â  I was feeling really fed up with the ongoing diarrhoea, fatigue and generalÂ  unwellness.Â  After 6 months of treatment with Matt I am now parasite and symptom free.  IÂ  have more energy and my partner has commented that the â€œold meâ€ is now backÂ  again.Â  I am no longer getting the strange vibrations or the hypoglycaemic episodes.  Iâ€™mÂ  also introducing small amounts of gluten back into my diet eating sourdoughÂ  bread with no ill effects.Â  It was a difficult 6 months of treatment as the diet was very restrictive (especiallyÂ  over Christmas), but it was absolutely worth it!  Not only have the parasites gone,Â  but my overall gut health is vastly improved.Â  Matt is a great practitioner and I would highly recommend him.  His knowledge ofÂ  gut health is extensive and his treatments work.  He is very professional and is aÂ  great educator, providing detailed explanations so that you understand whatâ€™sÂ  happening Heâ€™s also really supportive throughout the treatment, responding veryÂ  quickly to any queries and questions.Â </p>[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built="1" module_class="testi-cli" _builder_version="4.0.6" custom_padding="0px||0px||false|false"][et_pb_row _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_column type="4_4" _builder_version="4.0.6"][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.0.6" header_2_font="Montserrat|600|||||||" header_2_text_color="#167d7f" header_2_font_size="39px"]<h2>Sally (NSW, Australia)Â </h2>[/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version="4.7.7" text_font="Montserrat|600|||||||" text_text_color="#000000" text_font_size="24px" text_line_height="45px" text_orientation="center" custom_padding="30px||||false|false"]<h3><strong></strong></h3>

I am super grateful for Matt's guidance and wholistic approach. His approach is deeply informed and considered. Not long after staring Matt's regime, I started to feel well and I had energy.

I knew I wanted to feel healthier overall and eliminate the pain and imbalances completely. After Dr.â€™s tests couldnâ€™t locate an actionable issue for my digestive symptoms, Mattâ€™s recommended tests did. Working with Matt to resolve these issues collaboratively was enlightening and supportive. It was honestly one of the best investments for my health. Recovery after working with Matt has seen me being able to live healthier, enjoy food again with friends and family and envision greater health goals for myself. I have recommended Matt to family and friends and cannot thank him enough for the invaluable expertise and support he provided.</p>

I was admitted to hospital and remained there for 14days. After many tests nothing was diagnosed. A couple of months later I decided to move to Sydney where I had some more tests. Immediately they found trace of a parasite.</span></p>
<p>My health had deteriorated rapidly, I had no energy, moody,tired,headaches,poor circulation the list was endless. I found it very hard to deal with because before that I was training six days a week and running 10k and 21k races etc.</p>
<p>Matt @ Digestive Wellness came on recommendation to me. After my consultation we introduced a plan of supplements and dietary to work with over the coming months.</p>
<p>Just 2 weeks in I noticed a big change in how I was starting to feel for the better. My energy levels have started to lift again almost immediately, so I was absolutely stoked with that and that gave me the will to push harder towards our final goal of getting me back to where I was before I fell ill. So a little over a year later I have never felt better, sleeping, eating, training again and just feeling so good in myself.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend Matt to anyone! I felt from my consultation the weight of the past number of months had just been lifted because Matt was so knowledgeable about his findings and the plan that was immediately implemented. A massive thank you Matt I cannot thank you enough.</p>

<p>In desperation, I found Matt and via phone consultations between my home in Queensland and his office in Sydney he turned it all around. Having far more knowledge than anyone else I had seen, he was able to quickly identify I had SIBO (confirmed by a test). His approach was evidence-based, the treatment was specific to the problems I was experiencing, and his support materials were excellent.</p>
